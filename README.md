## Documentation

Reddit is unfairly raising their API prices which is destroying third party applications.

Hubbot is an open source alternative to gather news, personal stories and experiences all in one place

Discover anything:
- As more people join the community it will get even better
- Create your own communities called Hubs
- Explore from your personalized trending feed (powered by ML) or your subscriptions feed.

## For You Feed (FYF)

Similar to the for you page on TikTok - The FYF shows you trending and hot stories or images based on your prior interests. 

Its designed to show you things you love and things you didnt know you liked

## Subscriptions Feed

All of the hubs that you are a part of will show their most recent and posts that you missed into this feed so you never miss a moment.

## Development Setup

This is going to require a lot of work, and if you want to contribute to make this better it is easy to set up

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]

### Setting Up a Project

Install React globally:

```
npm install -g @react
```

Install NPM packages / dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run the development server

```
cd Hubbot
npm run start
```

### MACOS Users

You might have to either enable permissions for your project directory for vscode (or your editor)

Otherwise you will get access error. Also if NPM is giving you issues in the terminal make sure you run the command as 

``sudo npm [blah blah]``

so you run as administrator.

## Firebase

Planning on using firebase for this, but also might opt for a custom server
